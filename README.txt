This repository contains the library files previously flashed by the Glitch kernel installer zips.

---> lightslib proved necessary to make BLN work with Blinky on CM7.1 stable.

---> sensorlibs bricked the hell out of my phone on CM7.1, so use it at your own risk.

---> I have not tested BLN yet, so I don't know if it will work or bring about the apocalypse or both.

I am not responsible if using these files bricks your phone.

If you're not sure you should flash either of these, then don't!

I've provided them mainly because I took them out of my current build of the glitch kernel, and in case
anyone discovers that they still need to have them in order for their stuff to work.

USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!!

MAKE A BACKUP FIRST!!!!!

Seriously, make a backup.

No, really. Do it.
